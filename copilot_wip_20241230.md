The error indicates that the package `some-hal` could not be found in the crates.io index. This seems to be a placeholder name or an incorrect package name in your `Cargo.toml` file.

### **Steps to Fix the Issue**

1. **Check Cargo.toml for Correct Dependencies**:
   - Open the `Cargo.toml` file in your RTIC app project and ensure all dependencies have correct names.

2. **Update or Add Dependencies**:
   - If `some-hal` is a placeholder, replace it with the actual name of the hardware abstraction layer (HAL) crate you intend to use. For example, if you are using an STM32 HAL, you might add:

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   cortex-m-rtic = "1.0"  # Add the correct version
   stm32f4xx-hal = "0.9"  # Example for an STM32F4 series HAL
   ```

### **Example Updated Cargo.toml**

Here's a simplified example of what your `Cargo.toml` might look like:

```toml
[package]
name = "my-rtic-app"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]
cortex-m-rtic = "1.0"
stm32f4xx-hal = "0.9"  # Replace with the actual HAL crate you're using
```

### **Rebuild the Docker Image**

After updating the `Cargo.toml` file, rebuild the Docker image:

```bash
./blddoc.sh
```

This should resolve the issue with the missing package and allow the build process to complete successfully.
